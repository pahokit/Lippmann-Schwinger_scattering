In this project I discussed the Lippmann-Schwinger equation and its properties for various potentials in a numerical way. After discretizing the equation I was able to solve it numerically as a linear equation system. With the help of Wolfram Mathematica I was able to calculate the momentum-space form of the potentials, which I used for the solution. I tried to give a broader analysis of this theorem, namely I investigated the phase shift and the cross section given by the l = 0 sector approximation of the partial wave analysis.
The results can be seen on the figures, where I plotted the phase shift, its tangent and the cross section as a function of the initial center of mass energy. I was able to see resonances in the cross section curves and examples for the phase shift with positive and negative values, too.
I was able to detect incoordination in some phase shifts. In the first case I came to the conclusion that the Gauss elimination algorithm should be more precise for excercises that require this amount of operations. In the second case, I detected a "singularity" in the phase shift.
